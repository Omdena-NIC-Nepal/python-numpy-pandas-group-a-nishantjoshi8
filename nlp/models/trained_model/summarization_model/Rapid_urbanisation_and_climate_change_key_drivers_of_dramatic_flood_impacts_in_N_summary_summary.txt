Rapid urbanisation and climate change key drivers of dramatic flood impacts in Nepal
Landslides blocked all highways out of Kathmandu, with only the Prithvi Highway partially reopened.
Nepal has seen many heavy rainfall events followed by severe flooding in the past.
Our best estimate is that heavy 3-day rainfall events have become about 18% more intense and just over twice more likely, but there are substantial differences between the datasets, which limit our confidence in the accuracy of these figures.
The Kathmandu Valley is also not thefocus of flood risk management efforts in Nepal, as other regions (notably Terai) generally have been classified as high risk and have historically seen highly impactful floods.
