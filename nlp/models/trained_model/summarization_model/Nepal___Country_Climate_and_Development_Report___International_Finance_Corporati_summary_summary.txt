As temperatures rise across South Asia, climate and disaster risks in Nepal are expected to increase further, affecting people, the economy, the environment, and development gains.
Nepalâ€™s temperature is projected to increase by about 0.9 C between 2016 and 2045 under a medium-range emissions pathway.
While Nepal has low per capita emissions and is a negligible contributor to global climate change, agricultural and energy-related emissions are also a key source of air pollution, with major negative economic implications.
Women, indigenous people, and other marginalized communities are disproportionately affected.
