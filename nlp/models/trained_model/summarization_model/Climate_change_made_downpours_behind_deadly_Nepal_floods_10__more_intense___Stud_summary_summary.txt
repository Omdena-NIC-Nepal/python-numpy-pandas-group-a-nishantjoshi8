Climate change made downpours behind deadly Nepal floods 10% more intense – Study
The lethallate September floods in Nepalwere caused by rainfall made about 10 per cent more intense by climate change, according tothe latest rapid analysisby World Weather Attribution scientists issued yesterday.
The study highlights the “urgent need to limit development in low-lying, riverside areas of cities and scale up early warning and early action,” a WWA press release says.
“Minimizing the construction of homes in unsafe, flood-prone areas will help reduce the impacts of future floods there.“We also know that people who can’t read, a disproportionate number of them women in Nepal, are especially vulnerable to floods as they miss out on information to prepare – so improving education and reducing inequality is vital to make people more resilient to climate change.”
The Nepal Red Cross last month distributed relief supplies here village in Bethanchowk municipality, where around 50 houses and most infrastructure were completely or partly destroyed.
