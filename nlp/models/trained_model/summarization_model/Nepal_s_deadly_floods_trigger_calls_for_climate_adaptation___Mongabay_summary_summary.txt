Nepal is grappling with the aftermath of record floods that killed at least246 people, including 32 children.
“Across the country, people are busy clearing debris from floods and landslides while major highways remain disrupted,” Manjeet Dhakal, the Kathmandu-based South Asia director at Climate Analytics, told Mongabay in an email.
For Dhakal, this presents an opportunity to invest in energy diversification via other renewable sources.
More than 1.9 million Nepalese citizens, or 7% of the total population, are consideredhighly vulnerableto climate change, according to a 2010 assessment.
At the domestic level, political will is essential for both immediate responses and long-term recovery,” he added.
