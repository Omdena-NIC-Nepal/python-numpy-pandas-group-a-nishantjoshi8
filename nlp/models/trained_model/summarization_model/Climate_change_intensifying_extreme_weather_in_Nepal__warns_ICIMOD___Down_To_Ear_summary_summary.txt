Much of Kathmandu is now submerged, with the Bagmati river swelling well above danger levels, ICIMOD stated in a press note.
With soil already saturated from an unusually wet monsoon season, this weekend’s rains fell on highly vulnerable ground, amplifying the damage.
Poorly planned settlements and rampant construction on flood-prone areas mean that drainage systems cannot cope with the volume of water during extreme weather events, ICIMOD stated.
Yet, despite these advances, experts say that without more comprehensive planning and investment in climate-resilient infrastructure, Nepal will continue to face mounting losses from extreme weather.
The region’s vulnerability to climate change, coupled with haphazard development, means that every monsoon season could bring fresh devastation.
