Migration, Environment and Climate Change Nexus in Nepal: Policy Brief [EN/NE]
Climate change induced extreme events coupled with environmental degradation are leading to more displacement and involuntary migration increasing global vulnerability (IPCC, 2022).
A regional study conducted in 2016 in Nepal, Bangladesh and Maldives concluded that uncertainties caused by climate change impacts on livelihood options were influencing human mobility (IOM, 2017).
Weather related disaster events are a major cause for displacement in Nepal: Between 2011-2021, 3.4 million were displaced and 245 disaster events were recorded in Nepal (IDMC and ADB, 2022).
The UNFCCC notes that the adverse impacts of disasters and climate change on human mobility can be averted or minimized if concerted actions are prescribed under international law (UNFCCC, 2019).
