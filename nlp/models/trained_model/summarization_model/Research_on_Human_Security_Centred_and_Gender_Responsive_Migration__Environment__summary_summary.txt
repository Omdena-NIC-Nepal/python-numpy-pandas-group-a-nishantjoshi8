Kathmandu –The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has launched an insightful research report exploring the intricate nexus between human security, gender dynamics, and climate-induced migration in Nepal.
The report examines the impacts of both sudden and gradual environmental changes, illustrating how these phenomena drive forced and voluntary migration across Nepal's diverse communities.
A key focus of the report is the inclusion of vulnerable groups, such as displaced persons and highly vulnerable households, in government-led development and climate adaptation initiatives.
He remarked, “This research underscores the urgency of adopting human-security-centered and gender-responsive strategies to address the interconnected challenges of migration, environmental change, and climate resilience.”
