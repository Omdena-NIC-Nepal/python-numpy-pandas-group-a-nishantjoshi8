For example, there has been less rain at crucial times, leading to poor rice yields, where husks grow instead of grains.
Some villagers have left their fields fallow due to persistent crop damage caused by pests and changing weather patterns.
“Every year, we have to spend around 40,000 rupees for rice,” Gita Rai, another farmer in the locality, says.
However, these improvements are overshadowed by the ever-growing problem of drought, water scarcity, and a decline in agricultural productivity.
These events are depleting soil fertility and increasing pest infestations, all of which have dire consequences for food production.
