The honeycomb extract is also known as "mad honey," for its intoxicating qualities that can cause hallucinations.
Before every hunting trip, the hunters perform a ritual lasting almost an hour to ask for protection.
To make amends, they sacrifice a rooster, for example, and also give eggs or rice as gifts.
Smoke produced by burning leaves and small branches is intended to drive the bees away from their honeycomb (left).
