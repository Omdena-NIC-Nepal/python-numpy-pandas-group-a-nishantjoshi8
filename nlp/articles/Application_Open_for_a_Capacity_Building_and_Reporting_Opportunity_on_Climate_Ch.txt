Application Open for a Capacity Building and Reporting Opportunity on Climate Change and DRR in the Nepal-India Context

Overview of the Initiative

The "Strengthening Transboundary Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Reporting in the Nepal-India Context" initiative, implemented by Youth Innovation Lab with support from UNESCO Nepal, aims to enhance the capacity of media organizations in Nepal and India to effectively report on climate change and Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). This initiative targets the shared climate challenges faced by both countries, with a specific focus on the impacts of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs), natural resource extraction, and other climate-induced disasters across the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) region.

The project aims to foster regional collaboration, improve data-driven journalism, and combat climate misinformation. It also seeks to strengthen investigative reporting through the integration of AI and digital tools such as data visualization, fact-checking, and geospatial mapping. This will empower journalists to report on climate issues with greater accuracy, depth, and context, ultimately contributing to more informed public discourse and policymaking.

Program objectives

Improve the capacity of media organizations in Nepal and India to report effectively on:

Climate change impacts, vulnerabilities, and adaptation strategies in the context of natural resource extraction and the HKH region.

Disaster risk reduction measures, with a focus on the implications of unsustainable extraction practices and GLOF risk reduction.

Build media’s institutional capacities to use accessible digital tools for solutions-oriented reporting on transboundary disaster impacts. Training will cover data visualization (e.g., Google Data Studio), basic data analysis, and introductory geospatial mapping (e.g., Google Earth) to track environmental changes. Journalists will also develop skills in local data sourcing and cross-border collaboration, enabling impactful and resource-efficient storytelling.

Develop and implement shared media action plans:

Strengthen transboundary media networks to facilitate information sharing and collaborative reporting on climate change, DRR, natural resource extraction, and GLOF risks supporting joint investigative or solutions-oriented reporting projects and shared media production, ultimately improving cross-border communication on climate issues.

Why should you participate?

The impacts of climate change and natural disasters, particularly in the HKH region, transcend national borders. Issues such as GLOFs, deforestation, soil erosion, and changes in water resources require coordinated regional responses. Despite their significance, the media coverage of such transboundary issues is often fragmented or misrepresented.
