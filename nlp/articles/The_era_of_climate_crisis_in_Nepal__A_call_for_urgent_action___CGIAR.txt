Nepal is already grappling with the climate crisis, facing complex disasters beyond our previous experience and capacity to manage.

Unprecedented rainfall between 27 and 29 September, 2024 devastated the country. More than228 lives were lostand many remain missing. More than 15 hydropower projects, generating over 1,000 MW, were damaged. Preliminary assessments indicate losses ofNPR4.35 billion (USD 32 million)across  hydropower, irrigation, and river control infrastructure. In addition, there has been major damage to roads, settlements,andother infrastructure, the initial estimate of total loss isNPR 17 billion(126 million USD).

Kathmandu, Nepal’s capital, experienced record-breaking rainfall, with more than300 mm recordedin some parts of Kathmandu valley in just three days. The flood levels and the scale of inundation surpass anything recorded in the city’s long history. The full extent of the damage, including the destruction of homes, critical infrastructure, businesses, and agricultural land, remains to be fully evaluated.

Atypical disasters happening more frequently

In recent years, Nepal has experienced an increase in disasters driven by extreme weather, resulting in significant loss of life and property. In June 2021,a cascading series of disasters in Melamchitriggered by extreme rainfall and other hydrogeological processes caused extensive damage to the lower Indrawati region, amounting to NPR 66 billion (USD 498 million). Later that same year, an extreme rainfall event in western Nepal destroyed 110,000 ha of rice fields ready for harvest, leading to losses worth NPR 12 billion (USD 89 million).

In 2023, heavy rainfall in eastern Nepal damaged hydropower infrastructure, causing an estimated NPR 8.5 billion (USD 63 million) in damage. Then, in July 2024,in the western Nepal Kanchanpur district. This extreme weather event caused an estimated NPR 1.5 billion (USD 11 million) in damage, severely impacting agriculture, livestock, irrigation, and water supply infrastructure.

These are just a few examples of the extreme climate events Nepal has experienced in recent years. However, such unprecedented disasters are not confined to Nepal alone. We have witnessed similar extreme-weather-induced events globally, includingdevastating floods in Europe(2021), theChamoli disasterin India (2021), the catastrophicIndus River floodsin Pakistan (2022), theSikkim floodsin India (2023), andHurricane Helenein the United States (2024). These events illustrate a growing trend of climate-driven hazards impacting communities around the world – even in wealthier countries with greater adaptive capacity.

Outbursts of urgency

As one of the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world, Nepal is experiencing some of the most severe impacts. The impacts are disproportionately felt by marginalized and Indigenous communities with limited adaptive capacity.

Increasingly, many of these communities are facing risks from rapidly melting glaciers, which can lead to glacial lake outburst floods. In August 2024,two such outburstscaused significant damage in Thame village, located in the Mt. Everest region. There are around 25,000 other glacial lakes in the Himalayas, with47 identified as potentially dangerousin the Koshi, Gandaki, and Karnali river basins shared by Nepal, China, and India. However, only a few glaciers are regularly monitored, and even fewer have established early warning systems.

As global temperatures continue to rise, these risks position Nepal at the forefront of the climate crisis. The country’s unique geography, fragile ecosystems, and socioeconomic constraints increase the whole country’s vulnerability to climate change impacts. From unpredictable weather patterns and increasing climatic extremes to the accelerated melting of glaciers, Nepal’s future is becoming increasingly uncertain.

The way forward: Building climate resilience

With Nepal facing climate crises that directly impact people’s livelihoods and the national economy, building climate resilience has become an urgent priority.

First, Nepal must strengthen its disaster preparedness and early warning systems to better protect vulnerable communities from floods, landslides, and glacial lake outbursts. Investing in resilient infrastructure – such as water supply, hydropower, roads, and irrigation systems – is essential to safeguard lives and livelihoods.

Second, promoting community-based adaptation measures is crucial, particularly in rural areas. These efforts should prioritize improved water conservation, nature-based solutions, climate-smart agriculture, and sustainable farming practices. Nepal has a rich history of pioneering locally led adaptation, which needs to be scaled up and expanded. Additionally, blending local and Indigenous management practices will enhance the effectiveness of these adaptation measures.

Third, the international community must support Nepal’s climate adaptation and mitigation efforts. The country’s National Adaptation Plan outlines 64 priority programs through 2050, requiring an estimated USD 47 billion for effective mitigation and adaptation (i.e. approximately USD 2 billion annually). Developed nations, which have historically contributed the majority of global emissions, must fulfill their commitments to provide financial and technical assistance to vulnerable countries like Nepal. Climate financing is essential for enabling Nepal to invest in renewable energy, enhance disaster management systems, and develop climate-resilient infrastructure. Additionally, Nepal must strengthen its policies to create an enabling environment that facilitates the flow of climate finance to effectively accelerate climate action.

As Nepal faces more frequent and severe floods, droughts, and glacial melt the need for urgent action is clear. While progress has been made much more is needed at both the national and international levels. The window of opportunity to act is closing rapidly. If the world fails to take immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, vulnerable nations like Nepal will transition from experiencing climate crises to facing a full-blown climate emergency. We must act decisively and urgently now.
