Children and Youth at the Center of Nepal’s Climate Change Agenda

Kathmandu, April 27: More than 100 children and youth from across the country have expressed concern about climate change and the crisis it has created.

Gathered for the Children and Youth Dialogue in the capital on Saturday, they discussed climate change response led by children and youth in the context of the international ‘Sagarmatha Dialogue’ being organized by the government.

At the program, 20-year-old Nischal Bhatta said climate change is not a concern of the future, it is a reality of today. “We demand an environment conducive to ensuring climate justice and building a climate-resilient society.”

The first session discussed the impact of climate change on basic services such as education, health and water. The second session highlighted mountain ecology, climate change and the future of humanity, in line with the main theme of the Sagarmatha Dialogue to be held from 16 to 18 May.

In the dialogue, children, adolescents and youth shared their first-hand experiences on climate change and the efforts they are making at their level. A key achievement of the program was the declaration prepared by the participating children and youth.

The declaration includes their demands, commitments and proposed actions for building a climate-resilient Nepal. This declaration will be submitted to the secretariat ahead of the Sagarmatha Dialogue.
